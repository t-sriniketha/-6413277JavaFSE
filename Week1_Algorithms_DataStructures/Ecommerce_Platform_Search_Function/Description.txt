Searching

In the given exercise, we make use of two popular searching algorithms:
1.Linear Search
2.Binary Search

Depending on the problem, the data we can choose the better one by calculating its Time Complexity

Incase of Linear Search, its time Complexity is in the range of O(n).
For Binary search, time complexity is in range of O(log n).
Note: To use Binary Search, the data must be sorted.

O() ----> Big Oh Notation
Big Oh notation is used to describe the worst case Time complexity.
